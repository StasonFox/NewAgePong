#### Description: An updated version of the video game Pong
My project is an updated version of the game Pong. I have always liked Pong because
 it's one of the original games that has stood the test of time and it's really fun
 to play depite its simplicity. My version of Pong is updated with sound and colors. 
 The ball is also a circle instead of a square, so that's something!

I originally made a version of Pong out of the Scratch programming language for the
 Harvard CS50T course and I thought it would be cool to see the comparison of how
 Pong is made with Python. I was trying to decide if I should make the game playable
 with two characters where one player used 'w' and 's' for moving the paddle up and
 down and the other player used the Up and Down arrows. I decided that it would be best
 to have one player against an AI. Besides, I find playing against the computer more
 entertaining due to the challenge. One other benefit of playing against the AI is that
 you can control the difficulty by adjusting the speed of the ball and the paddles.

I chose a window size of 800 x 600 instead of something crazy like 4K resolution. I
 created the ball and paddles and set them in the correct locations in the window. I set
 the background color to black and the paddles and score to blue since it's my favorite
 color. I also chose yellow as the color of the ball since it stood out and was a good
 contrast to blue. I added the computer and player scores to the top of the screen and
 made it so that they update as each side scores.  

I adjusted the speed of the ball and the paddles to my liking. I added keybinds for the
 right paddle so that the player can control it with the up and down  arrows and I made
 it so that the computer paddle automatically follows the ball up and down on the y axis.
 I also created a while loop that keeps the game continuously updating.

I made it so that the ball bounces off the sides as well as the paddles and I added an
 old school video game sound for every collision that the ball makes. I also made it so 
 that the score updates and the ball is reset to the original position in the middle of
 the window once the ball hits either the left or right side. I designed it to declare
 the winner once a score of 10 is reached on either side. Overall, this was a fun project
 to make and it's just a fun game to play.
